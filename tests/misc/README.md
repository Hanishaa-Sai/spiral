Miscellaneous testing utilities
===============================

The small programs in this directory are utilities I used during testing and development.  The most useful is `compare`, which takes an oracle file as input, compares the splits produced by Spiral, and outputs the results.  Example of use:

```
./compare ../data/ludiso.tsv
```

Use the `-h` help option on `compare` to find out more about the command-line options it understands.
